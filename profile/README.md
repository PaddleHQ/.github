Hello, we're Paddle! ðŸ‘‹ We make [Paddle Billing](https://www.paddle.com/billing?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-github-org), [Paddle Retain](https://www.paddle.com/retain?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-github-org), and [ProfitWell Metrics](https://www.paddle.com/profitwell-metrics?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-github-org).

With the Paddle platform, you can build faster, scale sooner, and reduce risk â€” automatically. Our API-first platform takes care of payments, tax, subscriptions, and metrics, freeing you up to focus on building great products.

## Plug in Paddle

Listed here, you'll find libraries and tools to make integrating Paddle a pleasure. Use our hand-crafted SDKs to speed up development, and grab our OpenAPI spec to work with the Paddle API as part of your own workflows and tools. You can also find us on [the Postman public API network](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/29428794-16aca740-3ad6-4c1a-97be-05dbc504b4c3?action=collection/fork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D29428794-16aca740-3ad6-4c1a-97be-05dbc504b4c3%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D5ed2587a-f47e-43e0-810c-0c3e782bca12#?env[Sandbox]=W3sia2V5IjoiYmFzZVVybCIsInZhbHVlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zYW5kYm94LWFwaS5wYWRkbGUuY29tIiwiZW5hYmxlZCI6dHJ1ZSwidHlwZSI6ImRlZmF1bHQifSx7ImtleSI6ImJlYXJlclRva2VuIiwidmFsdWUiOiIiLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlLCJ0eXBlIjoic2VjcmV0In1d).

## We ðŸ’› open source

As well as tools for integrating Paddle, you'll find tools that we've built and open-sourced here, too.

Like most companies, we use open source software every day at Paddle. Open source helps us ship great products for our customers, as well as making our working lives more enjoyable. We're grateful to the open source community, and look to contribute to projects, host community events in our hubs, and open-source our own tools where we can.

We believe community contributions make the Paddle platform better for everyone, so we welcome issues and pull requests in all our public repos.
